Issues during dev:

When I created room Bedroom, I think I added my background texture directly to the Background scene instead of to the node in the Room scene. This meant that my character never showed up.

Many of the "create new" popups should put focus on the name of the object instead of the ok button -- you can't click ok until you provide a name.
