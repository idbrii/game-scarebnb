Issues during dev:

* When I created room Bedroom, I think I added my background texture directly to the Background scene instead of to the node in the Room scene. This meant that my character never showed up.

* Many of the "create new" popups should put focus on the name of the object instead of the ok button -- you can't click ok until you provide a name.


* Doesn't show how to make it the main scene:
