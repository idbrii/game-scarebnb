# Scare BnB

## Pitch

You run the BnB and need to chat with ghost guests, solve their problems to help them move on. The Irregularity Inspector could be the climax of the adventure where you need to keep sending them astray to give you "time" to send off the rest of the guests.
Maybe even keep the old adventure game scoring so you don't have to 100% to finish, but get a different final score if you help everyone.
could add human guests too, so there's interplay between balancing regular human guests and ghosts. Don't let the humans get too spooked.
could buy decorations with your earnings. Particular decorations the ghosts can possess/hide in.


By talking to ghosts, figure out what decorations/gifts/??? are best to help them have a good stay/move onto the afterlife (i.e., convos about their lives or whatever have hints to help you decide) OR even what they look like could have hints.


# Project Layout

This project is my starter that I use to create games in godot (mostly 2D games).

* ci/pushbuild.py - Script to export builds and upload them to itch.io
* addons/toggle-external-editor/ - checkbox to toggle between external editor and godot debugger
* addons/debugdraw2d/ - debug visualization tools

* code/common/ - nodes used in multiple games
* code/util/ - gdscript libraries for common logic
